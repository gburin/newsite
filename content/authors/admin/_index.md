I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Durham University (UK), working with macroevolutionary patterns of mutualism breakdowns in plants. My main interests are related to how biological interactions affect the diversification dynamics of different groups. I am also interested in how other biotic and abiotic factors affect the diversification of vertebrates. Moreover, I'm interested in method development and performance testing. Lastly, I am an open science enthusiast, and want to start blogging about it, general science and my personal interests in the near future.
