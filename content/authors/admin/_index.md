I am currently a Leverhulme postdoctoral fellow at the Natural History Museum in London (UK). My main interests are related to how biological interactions affect the diversification dynamics of different groups. I am also interested in how other biotic and abiotic factors affect the diversification of land vertebrates, and lately I have been working also with morphological evolution in marine mammals.

I am also interested in method development and performance testing. Lastly, I am an open science enthusiast, and want to start blogging about it, general science and my personal interests in the near future.
