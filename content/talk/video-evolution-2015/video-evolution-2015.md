I just found out (almost by accident) that the filming of my talk at the Macroevolution II session during the Evolution meeting last month in Guaruj√°, Brazil, is online [*(click here or on the image to watch it on youtube)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSZuK7Tu53E).

Please, feel free to leave any feedback! Any suggestion will be greatly appreciated!
