I just found out (almost by accident) that the filming of my talk at the Macroevolution I session during the Evolution meeting last June in Portland, OR, is online [*(click here or on the image to watch it on youtube)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvatMP2m5qw&t=3s).

Please, feel free to leave any feedback! Any suggestion will be greatly appreciated!
