The new paper from our lab is out! In this study, Dr. Laura Alencar explores if the evolution of arboreality in vipers
affects species and morphological diversification regimes. We found out that although arboreal vipers
evolve under a more constrained morphological trajectories compared to terrestrial vipers, 
speciation rates remain similar. This study was part of her PhD thesis, and was featured 
in the cover of Proceedings B with a beautiful image by one of the authors, Marcio Martins.
