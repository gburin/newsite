Last month my first paper got published a year after the first
submission. In this paper we assess how diet affects the
macroevolutionary dynamics of all bird species, and found that
omnivores - species that feed on multiple food items - have lower
(even negative) net diversification. This pattern arises from either
smaller speciation and/or greater extinction when compared to all
other dietary guilds.

Associated with that, there is a prevalence of transitions from all
guilds into omnivory. Based on these two patterns, we decided to call
omnivores a "macroevolutionary sink".
