This post is long overdue. I have finally updated my affiliation (finished my postdoc at the NHM and moved to Durham University, again as a PDRA), and added the latest papers I have published since the last update. I will try as best as I can to keep this updated, but don't expect much from me ;-)

If you want to see what I have been up to, head to the [publications page](https://www.gburin.com/#publications)!
